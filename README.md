# Command Line Mystery

## Overview

* The goal of this assignment is to solve the mystery by using ONLY the Terminal to navigate files.
* **Don't use a text editor** to view any files except `readme.md` and `cheatsheet.md`.

## Getting Started

* Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.

* Change directories into `command-line-mystery`, and start by reading the `instructions` file:

	```bash
	$ cd command-line-mystery
	$ cat instructions
	```

* Before diving into the mystery, create a new file called `solution.md`:

	```bash
	$ touch solution.md
	```

* Keep a list of the Terminal commands you type to solve the mystery in `solution.md`.

## Submission

* As you're working, commit your changes, and push them to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment, make a pull request from your fork back to the original repo.
